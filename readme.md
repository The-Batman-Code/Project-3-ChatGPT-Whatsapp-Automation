5. Open Google Chrome in the Cinnamon desktop, browse to whatsapp web and login your whatsapp account there
6. Python is already installed on this ubuntu version. Let's install python pip which helps in installing python libraries. Click on the terminal icon on the left corner to open the terminal window and enter the following command.
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
7. Now lets install the required python libraries one by one - 
```
sudo pip3 install pywhatkit
sudo pip3 install openai
sudo pip3 install schedule
```
8. Install tkinter using the following command - 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
```
9. Now it's time to run our python codeüòá. Enter the following command to create a python file named message.py - 
```
sudo vim message.py
```
10. Copy the code given in script.py python file here in the repository and press I to enter insert mode in vim. Paste the code into the message.py python file. Enter the receiver's phone number, schedule time and your openAI access token in message.py file (You can get you openAI access token from [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys))
11. We need the program to run even after we exit the rdp window that's why we will use tmux. Enter tmux into the terminal to enter the tmux window.
```
tmux
```
12. Enter the following command to run the python file in the tmux window - 
```
python3 message.py
```
13. To exit the tmux window press Ctrl + B and then D.
14. Back to the terminal window hun?üòè Congrats. Now see the project run at your scheduled time. You can safely exit you Chrome RDP window also‚úåÔ∏è.
15. To kill the tmux process enter the following command in the terminal- 
```
tmux kill-session
```
